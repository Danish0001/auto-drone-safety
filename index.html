		<center><h1>Improving Drone Safety</h1></center>
		<p> The purpose of this site is to improve the safety of drones by providing an easy to understand quiz which must be passed as a way to enable a drone device. By requiring that a drone user must pass the test to operate the drone, we can guarantee that all UAV users are understanding of drone laws. </p>
		<p> The basics of understanding drone laws are as follows according to the FAA assuming you are a standard recreational flyer.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Fly only for recreational purposes (enjoyment). </li>
			<li>Follow the safety guidelines of an FAA-recognized Community Based Organization (CBO). </li>
			<li>Keep your drone within the visual line of sight or use a visual observer who is co-located (physically next to) and in direct communication with you.</li>
			<li>Give way to and do not interfere with manned aircraft.</li>
			<li>Fly at or below 400' in controlled airspace (Class B, C, D, and E) only with prior authorization by using LAANC or DroneZone.</li>
			<li>Fly at or below 400 feet in Class G (uncontrolled) airspace. </li>
			<li>Take The Recreational UAS Safety Test (TRUST) and carry proof of test passage (coming soon).</li>
			<li>Have a current registration, mark (PDF) your drones on the outside with the registration number, and carry proof of registration with you.</li>
			<li>Do not operate your drone in a dangerous manner. For example:

    Do not interfere with emergency response or law enforcement activities.
    Do not fly under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
